# CODESTORM ELITE'S HACKATHON onAgriFinance: Data-Driven Access to Finance for Young Agripreneurs

## Overview

This project aims to bridge the finance gap in Nigerian agriculture by developing data-driven solutions to help young agripreneurs obtain access to affordable finance. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, we create tools that help financial institutions assess the creditworthiness of young farmers and make informed lending decisions.

## Problem Statement

- Only 27% of rural adults in Nigeria have access to formal financial services
- Only 6% of young people (18-25) have access to business loans
- Agriculture employs 35% of Nigeria's workforce but contributes less than 25% to GDP
- Commercial banks consider agriculture "too risky" due to climate variability, land tenure issues, and lack of credit history

## Solution

Our solution combines data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization to:

1. Identify creditworthy farmers through data-driven profiling
2. Predict repayment behavior and business success
3. Create tools for financial institutions to assess risk and make informed lending decisions

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- UV package manager

### Installation

1. Install UV:

```bash
    pip install uv
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Strategy

Our analysis leverages multiple data sources to build comprehensive farmer profiles:

- Agricultural production data
- Climate and weather patterns
- Market price trends
- Farmer demographic information
- Historical loan repayment data

## Credit Scoring Model

We developed a predictive model that assesses:

- Farmer creditworthiness
- Business success probability
- Risk factors and mitigation strategies

## Analysis and Insights

Key findings from our data analysis:

1. [Insert key insights about farmer creditworthiness]
2. [Insert findings about successful farming practices]
3. [Insert risk assessment patterns]

## Architecture

The solution is built on a modular architecture:

1. Data Collection and Processing Layer
2. Analysis and Modeling Layer
3. Visualization and Reporting Layer
4. API and Integration Layer

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with mobile banking platforms
- Real-time market price tracking
- Weather prediction integration
- Blockchain-based smart contracts for loan management
